# webSocketNodeJs
Basic clients communication via **Socket.io** in **Node.js**, created for those who recently started learning **websocket** along with **Node.js**


This repository will cover most of the basics of websocket communication including :

1. Message broadcasting from a single client to every other clients
2. Alert's a client when another client is connected to the server
3. Message broadcasting from a single client to some specific client(s)

here, client refers to a single HTML page.

Code is very simple and kind of self-explanatory. If you face any problem while using it, give me an email anytime :)
