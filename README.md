# webSocketNodeJs
Basic multi-client communication via **Socket.io** in **Node.js**, created for those who recently started learning **websocket** along with **Node.js**


This repository will cover most of the basics of websocket communication including :

1. Alert's a client as soon as a new client gets connected to the server
2. Message broadcasting from a single client to every other clients
3. Message broadcasting from a single client to some specific client(s)

here, client refers to a single HTML page.

Code is very simple and kind of self-explanatory.
